For thousands of years GMOs were in the minds of mankind, they just did not know it then. They started off small by selecting the best animals they had, then they mated them. This ideaology of choosing the best animals to mate was the forefront for genetic modifications. It allowed man to choose what genes were in thier animals. This method was the beginning of gene selection and the idea behind all  GMOs today. While poeple thousands of years ago used animals and time, today there is science and technology to genetially modify organisms.
